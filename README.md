## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
In 2018, Singapore received about 18 million International tourists with an average stay of about 3.7 days per visit, making Singapore the 5th most visited city in the world and 2nd in the Asia-Pacific.

25-34 year olds were the largest (23%) age group of visitors and survey data has shown that most visitors within this age group are likely to have travelled using their own itinerary. With more than 200 attractions in Singapore, significant effort is required to find attractions that fit a travellerâ€™s interests, preferences and context. Besides finding the right attractions, it is extremely inconvenient to find the best route between attractions manually by searching every attraction on Google Maps.

Based on the above considerations, our project aims to simplify and ease the process of itinerary planning by filtering attractions to fit the user preferences and automatically search for the best travel route between attractions.

The system consists of two parts: firstly, attraction recommendation. The system recommends attractions to travellers based on their personal preferences through a ranking mechanism and  enhances these recommendations with market basket analysis on the travel history of  TripAdvisor users with similar interests through Drools Rule Engine. 
Secondly, itinerary optimization. The system allows travellers to select from the recommended attractions and the selected attractions are then used to create an optimised travel itinerary by performing an optimization problem through optaplanner.

For the final result, travellers will get a full picture of how their trips in Singapore will be like: the best combinations of attractions for every day, directions between attractions, and even the promotions.
